Download:
=========

repo init -u git://github.com/tpruvot/android.git -b ics

repo sync

Note for DEFY+ :
After the first "repo sync" Edit your manifest .repo/manifest.xml

At the end of the file, change the revision of device/jordan to "ics_mb526"

You need also to change the vendor/motorola revision to "ics-plus"


Download RomManager (DELETED BY OUR BUILD SYSTEM)
=================================================

mkdir vendor/cyanogen/proprietary
cd vendor/cyanogen && ./get-rommanager


Build:
======

rm -rf out/target

For CM9 branch :
  source build/envsetup.sh && brunch jordan

or for AOSP :
  source build/envsetup.sh && lunch full_jordan-eng

Use the signed zip to update the defy with the bootmenu recovery, not the ota package !
